      <p>
      I switched my gears from my education in Business to take on Web Development to keep challenging myself in ways I thought I never could. 
      Web Development allows me to continually create and creatively find new ways to make processes better. I always believed that anything can be improved and 
      there are different ways to solve problems. I have finally found my passion.
      <br></br>
      With that being said, I am Full Stack Web Developer with a Bachelor’s Degree and 2+ years professional experience in Business Administration combined 
      with 3 different Liberal Arts Associate’s Degrees. I am a naturally curious person which makes me want to always learn new things. I am a problem-solver who 
      questions everything. I am a hard worker who doesn't take life too seriously and enjoys the little things. But most importantly, I love to have a good laugh.
